Featuring a paper like color scheme and increased font-size for headings","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/nylki/pen-paper-coffee-syntax"},"license":"MIT","engines":{"atom":">0.50.0"},"keywords":["markdown","light","brown","writing","citing"],"readme":"# Pen Paper Coffee :pencil2::scroll::coffee:\n*Pen Paper Coffee* is a syntax theme for the text editor [atom](http://atom.io/), which is designed specifically for writing papers, essays etc. in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).\nThe theme features increased font-sizes for each level of headers, several useful, but not distracting syntax highlightings.\nThe overall colors are inspired by the soft beige paper you would find in a notebook. While the ink (text color) is a dark blue, all quotes and citations are in a warm brownish orange to contrast them better to your own words. When writing text, not code, I usually set a line height of 1.4 or 1.5 in atoms settings, as you can see in the sample screenshots.\n\nAlthough this theme was designed for markdown usage, I paid attention that it still looks good and clear with other documents (eg. html, javascript, C).\n\nThe screenshots without gutter and text centering had [Zen](https://atom.io/packages/zen) installed, if you like to have centered text but still see the gutter, treeview and tabs [typewriter](https://atom.io/packages/typewriter) might be for you.\n\nWhen you want to cite stuff from eg. a bibtex file, I find a great package to use together with this theme is [autocomplete bibtex](https://github.com/apcshields/autocomplete-bibtex). It's a great help when combining it with [pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) for pdf & latex export from markdown.\n\n\n### screenshots\n\n![markdown with zen mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nylki/PenPaperCoffee-atom-syntax/master/screenshots/penPaperCoffe_1.png)\n\nsupport for critic markup:\n![critic markup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nylki/PenPaperCoffee-atom-syntax/master/screenshots/criticmarkup.png)\n\n![css screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nylki/PenPaperCoffee-atom-syntax/master/screenshots/penPaperCoffe_4.png)\n\nThe screenshots below  are a bit outdated now, (the gutter color is lighter now, as the screenshots above):\n\n![A screenshot of your theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nylki/PenPaperCoffee-atom-syntax/master/screenshots/penPaperCoffe_2.png)\n\n![A screenshot of your theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nylki/PenPaperCoffee-atom-syntax/master/screenshots/penPaperCoffe_3.png)\n\n## changes\n### 11. April 2015\nI changed the gutter to a lighter brown, which is much more pleasing, atleast to my eyes. If you prefer the darker gutter, just comment out and uncomment the following lines in `colors.less` to your liking:\n```.less\n// gutter colors\n@heftstreifen: rgb(224, 218, 211);\n\n//@heftstreifen: rgb(202, 193, 186); //old darker gutter\n```\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/nylki/pen-paper-coffee-syntax/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/nylki/pen-paper-coffee-syntax","_id":"pen-paper-coffee-syntax@0.9.1","_shasum":"14dce78f58151d7c72f8dbb4120f50b9d3424bd0","_resolved":"file:../d-11566-16264-heyvtv/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11566-16264-heyvtv/package.tgz"}
