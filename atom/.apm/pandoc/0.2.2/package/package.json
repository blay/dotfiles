This needs to be on your `PATH`.\n  * `pandoc.args` which are the command-line arguments to pandoc, defaults to `-s -S --self-contained`.\n  * `pandoc.languages`, a map of Atom grammar names to Pandoc input formats.\n\n## Limitations\n\n  * Only has HTML output at the moment\n  * Limited detection of input formats\n\n## Problems with PATH\n\nTo find the `pandoc` executable, ideally Atom should be able to find it on your `PATH`. Unfortunately, environment variables are a bit of an issue with GUI applications on OS X. Google it or see [Setting Environment Variables in OS X?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/135688/setting-environment-variables-in-os-x).\n\nFor the `atom` command, you need to make sure Atom is loaded via env (in some older versions of Atom it is not).\n\n    vim `which atom`\n\nIf you can find the following, you are fine:\n\n    open -a \"$ATOM_PATH/$ATOM_APP_NAME\" -n --args --executed-from=\"$(pwd)\" --pid=$$ --path-environment=\"$PATH\" \"$@\"\n\nIf you see the following instead:\n\n    open -a $ATOM_PATH -n --args --executed-from=\"$(pwd)\" --pid=$$ $@\n\nChange it to:\n\n    env open -a $ATOM_PATH -n --args --executed-from=\"$(pwd)\" --pid=$$ $@\n\nNow Atom will have access to `PATH`, and can find your `pandoc` command.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jagregory/atom-pandoc-preview/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jagregory/atom-pandoc-preview#readme","_id":"pandoc@0.2.2","_shasum":"24f90db83ee7a9937b5f1922d437bd999cc41323","_resolved":"file:../d-115117-65307-8zr6u2/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115117-65307-8zr6u2/package.tgz"}
