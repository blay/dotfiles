write good [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/btford/write-good.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/btford/write-good)\n\nNaive linter for English prose for developers who can't write good and wanna learn to do other stuff good too.\n\n\n## Use\n\n```shell\nnpm install write-good\n```\n\n**Important:** Do not use this tool to be a jerk to other people about their writing.\n\n\n## API\n\n`writeGood` is a function that takes a string and returns an array of suggestions.\n\n```javascript\nvar writeGood = require('write-good');\n\nvar suggestions = writeGood('So the cat was stolen.');\n\n// suggestions:\n//\n// [{\n//   suggestion: \"omit 'So' from the beginning of sentences\",\n//   index: 0, offset: 2\n// }, {\n//   suggestion: \"'was stolen' is passive voice\",\n//   index: 11, offset: 10\n// }]\n```\n\n`writeGood` takes an optional second argument that allows you to disable certain checks.\n\nYou can disable checking for passive voice like this:\n\n```javascript\nvar writeGood = require('write-good');\n\nvar suggestions = writeGood('So the cat was stolen', { passive: false});\n// suggestions: []\n```\n\n\n## CLI\n\nYou can use `write-good` as a command-line tool by installing it globally:\n\n```shell\nnpm install -g write-good\n```\n\n`write-good` takes a [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) and prints suggestions to stdout:\n\n```shell\n$ write-good *.md\n\nIn README.md\n=============\n = writeGood('So the cat was stolen.');\n                         ^^^^^^^^^^\n\"was stolen\" is passive voice on line 20 at column 40\n-------------\n//   suggestion: \"'was stolen' is passive voice\",\n                   ^^^^^^^^^^\n\"was stolen\" is passive voice on line 28 at column 19\n```\n\nYou can run just specific checks like this:\n\n```shell\nwrite-good *.md --weasel --so\n```\n\nOr exclude checks like this:\n\n```shell\nwrite-good *.md --no-passive\n```\n\n\n## Checks\n\nYou can disable any combination of the following by providing a key with value `false` as the second argument to `writeGood`.\n\n### `passive`\nChecks for passive voice.\n\n### `illusion`\nChecks for lexical illusions – cases where a word is repeated.\n\n### `so`\nChecks for `so` at the beginning of the sentence.\n\n### `thereIs`\nChecks for `there is` or `there are` at the beginning of the sentence.\n\n### `weasel`\nChecks for \"weasel words.\"\n\n### `adverb`\nChecks for adverbs that can weaken meaning: really, very, extremely, etc.\n\n### `tooWordy`\nChecks for wordy phrases and unnecessary words\n\n### `cliches`\nChecks for common cliches\n\n## See also\n\nI came across these resources while doing research to make this module.\nThey might be helpful.\n\n### Code\n\n* [shell script for avoiding \"weasel
