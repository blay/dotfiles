# writer-syntax theme

*Writer* is a theme designed to be easy on the eyes, especially for long periods
of writing either code or prose. The main color palette is designed around
three colors (green, blue, purple), and there are a number of light variants
and intermediate colors. It results in a very uniform and smooth color theme.
There are light and dark variants, accessible from the settings.

## Main features

- A lot of `gfm` support, including tables and CriticMarkup
- Highlighting of `FIXME`, `TODO`, `CHANGED`, and `XXX`
- Good looking comments!
- Support for `diff`
- Support for `indent-guide-improved`
- Support for `json`, `cson`
- Support for `python`
- Support for `tasks`

## Switch between Light and Dark

There is an option (in Settings, Themes) to use the Dark variant of the theme.
It requires to reload the current window.
