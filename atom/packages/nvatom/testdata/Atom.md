# Atom

Atom is a free and open-source text and source code editor for OS X, Linux, and Windows with support for plug-ins written in Node.js, and embedded Git Control, developed by GitHub. Most of the extending packages have free software licenses and are community-built and maintained. Atom is based on Chromium and written in CoffeeScript. It can also be used as an IDE.

## License

Initially, extension packages for Atom and anything not part of Atom's core were released under an open-source license. On 6 May 2014, the rest of Atom, including the core application, Atom's package manager, and Atom's Chromium-based desktop application framework, Atom Shell, were released as free software under the MIT License.
