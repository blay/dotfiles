# Notational Velocity

[Notational Velocity][1] is a computer program for Mac OS X used for notetaking. It allows users to create notes using solely a computer keyboard and search them using incremental find. Other features include database encryption, basic text formatting, tags and spellcheck. In addition, users can synchronize notes with Simplenote and export to a variety of formats, including plain text, HTML and rich text. It has been recommended along with Simplenote as a solution for taking and syncing notes by both Wired and Lifehacker.

Although Notational Velocity itself hasn't seen any development activity for some time, the nvALT fork is actively developed and has many additional features.
