Begin typing the title in the search panel. Press return to add a new note with the title. While typed, Notational Velocity searches for notes whose body or title contain your query. Note that naming a note and searching always occur simultaneously.

When the note you want to find is in the list, you can select notes by using the arrow keys. When you press enter, the selected note will appear on the editor. If your query is the title of the note, Notational Velocity would have selected the note automatically.

Notational Velocity constantly writes your changes to disk as you create and edit notes, so no need to "Save" anything manually.
