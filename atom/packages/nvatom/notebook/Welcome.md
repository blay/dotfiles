Welcome to Notational Velocity!

This is the body of a note. Your notes can be as long or as short as you want.

The notes are saved as a [Markdown][1] file, so you can freely use Markdown syntax to __embolden__ or _italicize_ them. Atom's [GFM][2] syntax highlight will automatically beautify these notes.

These notes were included to give you a sense what Notational Velocity is. You may delete them at any time.

For more information, please refer [Notational Velocity][3] and [nvALT][4].
