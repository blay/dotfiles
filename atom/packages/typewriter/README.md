# typewriter

Like a miniature version of [Zen](https://atom.io/packages/zen), this package improves the writing experience in Atom:

* Centered layout
* No gutter
* No scrollbar (unless you hover over the editor)
* But keeps the tabs, tree-view, minimap etc.
* Enables soft-wrapping for selected scopes

Works out of the box for (GF-)Markdown and MediaWiki files. Settings allow you to select the scopes that should trigger typewriter mode.
