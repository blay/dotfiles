# One-O-Eight

One-O-Eight is a mutli-schemes syntax. It comes with two backgrounds (white on
black or black on white), and (as of now) three foreground schemes: *Bright*,
*Viridis*, and *Calm*. All schemes are based on five colours; the name
one-o-eight comes from 108Â°, the internal angles in a pentagon.

## Variants overview

All screenshots use the free [Hack](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack) font
at 15pt, which is *great*. All variants use a palette with five colors, and each
color has a lighter variant.
