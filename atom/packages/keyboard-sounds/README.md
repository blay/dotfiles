# keyboard-sounds package

A small [Atom](https://atom.io) package that makes (mechanical) keyboard noise while you type.

Controls:

- `cmd-shift-k` to toggle sound. (On by default)
- `cmd-shift-k up` to increase volume. (Max volume by default)
- `cmd-shift-k down` to decrease volume.

To customize the controls, add these commands to your `keymap.cson` with your custom keymaps:

- `keyboard-sounds:toggle`
- `keyboard-sounds:volume-up`
- `keyboard-sounds:volume-down`
