### Links

<!-- Note: In Markdown.pl and most other markdown implementations, reference link definitions cannot occur in nested constructions such as list items or block quotes. Pandoc lifts this arbitrary seeming restriction. So the following is fine in pandoc, though not in most other implementations:
-->
* http://google.com
* <http://google.com>
* This is an [inline link](/url), and here's [one with
a title](http://fsf.org "click here for a good time!").
* Here is [my link][FOO]
* [my website]

E-Mails:

* <sam@green.eggs.ham>
* [Write me!](mailto:sam@green.eggs.ham)
